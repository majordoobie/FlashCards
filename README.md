Description:
  This is a flash card program used to help you study by displaying a question then 
  revealing the answer when you're ready to reveal it. Think of it as a deck of 
  flash cards, with questions on one side and answers on the other side.

  To start studying simply call the program with the -i option and give it the 
  full path of your file that you're using to study from.

  Keep in mind that the parser uses blank lines as it's delimiter between questions
  and answers. If you have too many lines in between or not enough it will mess up
  the order of your deck.
